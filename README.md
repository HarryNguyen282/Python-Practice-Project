This is a project to test the knowledge and skills in writing and application software for a task, understanding the business rule of a particular problem, coding these in a computer program, developing a graphical user interface, and reading data from a text file. The problem can be developed by yourself 

It is required to integrate in the code for the solution:
- A decision structure (IF-ELIF-ELSE)
- Control structure (WHILE/FOR)
- Use of strings, integers, float, Boolean as variables
- At least 2 different data structures (list, tuple, set, dictionary)
- At least 2 user-defined functions
- A command line menu
- Reading from a file and write to a file
- Implement exception handling
- Produce a GUI for the solution

Self-developed problem:

Assuming the distance from point A to point B is 500km and the road to go from point A to point B is a straight line. A car travels from A to B at 100.5km/h (car A). Another car travels from B (car B) at 80km/h. Calculate the time two car will meet after car A starts going for each situation below:

Situation1: Two cars travel with the reverse direction, the velocity of both cars remains the same during the travelling process
- car A travels at the same time with car B
- car A travels 1 hour before car B
- car A travels 2 hours before car B

Situation 2: Two cars travel with the same direction, thereâ€™s road maintenance starting from A when A starts going, after finishing road work distance, the velocity of both cars remains the same during the travelling process
- Car A travels at the same time with car B, 50km road maintenance remaining, speed in maintenance road is 40km/h
- Car A travels 1 hour before car B, 100km road maintenance remaining, speed in maintenance road is 50km/h
- Car A travels 2 hours before car B, 150km road maintenance remaining, speed in maintenance road is 60km/h

The provided road_maintain_info.txt only has 2 lines of road maintenance information and needs to be added with the third case (2hrs-60km/h-150km)
